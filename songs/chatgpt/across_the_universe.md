***Me:  Please can you write a song to the tune of “Across the Universe” by the Beatles?***

**ChatGPT:  Sure! Here is a song to the tune of "Across the Universe" by the Beatles:**

#Verse 1:#
Sitting in my room
Thinking about the world outside
So much happening
I don't know where to start

Chorus:
But one thing is for certain
Love is all we need
It's the only thing that matters
In this world full of greed

Verse 2:
So let's come together
And spread some love and joy
We can make a difference
If we all employ

Chorus:
The power of love and compassion
It can move mountains high
So let's make a new resolution
To love and never say goodbye

Bridge:
The universe is vast and wide
But love can reach across the divide
It's the only way to truly survive
In this crazy world we're living in

Outro:
So let's sing this song
For all the world to hear
Love is all we need
To bring us all together, my dear
